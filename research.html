          <p>Most of my work makes use of the unique capabilities of the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT). We operate nine 1-meter and two 2-meter telescopes, all robotically controlled via an online scheduling interface. Because our sites are distributed longitudinally around the globe, especially in the southern hemisphere, we can start observing transient phenomena (e.g. supernovae) almost immediately after discovery, even if weather is bad at one or more sites.</p>
          <p>The LCOGT Supernova Key Project (P.I. Andy Howell) is a three-year mission to explore strange new stars, to seek out new types and new classifications, to boldly know what no one has known before. We expect to obtain follow-up photometry and spectroscopy of about 600 supernovae over the course of the project. We are a part of almost every supernova survey currently in operation, and we work with scientists on every continent.</p>

          <h2>Type Ibn Supernovae</h2>
          <p>My current project is a sample analysis of Type Ibn supernovae. These are supernovae that exhibit narrow helium lines but weak to nonexistent hydrogen features in their spectra. They are thought to result when very massive stars explode into a helium-rich circumstellar medium (CSM).</p>
          <p>Very few of these objects have been found, although with the advent of large surveys, this number is now increasing more quickly. Most have only been analyzed in single-object papers focusing on their peculiarities with respect to previously published objects. My upcoming paper is an attempt to bring some order to the field by examining the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the class as a whole.</p>
          <p>The most surprising result is that Type Ibn light curves are relatively homogeneous. This is in stark contrast to Type IIn supernovae (also CSM-interacting, but with hydrogen present), which, due to the diverse and potentially complex density profiles of their CSM, can have almost any light curve shape imaginable.</p>
          <p>I also found that Type Ibn spectra can be divided into two subclasses at early times: those dominated by very narrow helium P Cygni lines and those domiated by narrow helium emission atop broad features. This may offer a hint as to the range of progenitor systems that can result in Type Ibn supernovae.</p>
